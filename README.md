<h1>Can't find games when searching Matchmaking (Microsoft Store Version)</h1>
This version of the game is still broken as of September 2nd 2025. It broke on February 28th 2025.
No fix is in sight. Buy the game on Steam in the meantime.

<h1>Connecting To Server (and other login issues)</h1>

2025 Update: This MAY be caused by a timezone mismatch; be 100% sure your timezone is set properly on your PC before proceeding.

Typical cause of this issue is an Xbox Session loop - basically the server cant confirm you’re logged in or not. A simple log in/out can resolve this in most cases.
If a relog doesn’t resolve the issue for you, you can try clearing all of your XBL Session keys using the following steps.
Close MCC completely
Hit Windows Key
Type "cmd" into the search bar that opens (it should find a command prompt) and open it.
Copy paste "for /F "tokens=1,2 delims= " %F in ('cmdkey /list ^| findstr Xbl') do  cmdkey /delete %G" into the opened command prompt window.
Relaunch MCC and log back in
Note: If you put this into a batch command instead (by creating your own .bat file), replace %F with %%F.
You can also manually delete these entries in the Credential Manager. The above batch file saves you a lot of manual effort, but here’s how to do it manually.
Open Credential Manager, Navigate to Windows Credentials, and find and delete every key containing “XBL”. Delete them by clicking the dropdown error and clicking “Remove”.
343 has acknowledged this issue and in addition to the steps above suggest clearing your web cache.

Never worked from my experience but listing here for reference.
If you receive an error around Phone Verification the following Cache/Clear step appears to fix it.

Note: This also fixes the “We can’t sign you in because your account has been suspended from Xbox Live” as shown below.

Steps to resolve:

1) Have someone else log into your account.
2) Clear your XbL credentials as mentioned above
3) Log back into your account.

As far as I can tell this is caused by a temporary IP ban from Microsoft from making multiple accounts.
Removing the credentials seems to remove the traces and allow you to queue again.

I dont know, I don’t make the rules I can only attempt to interpret them.

I've also included a batch script here that you can use.

<h1>Not Spawning (Stuck on Scoreboard at start)</h1>
This happens mainly in H2A games.
Leave and rejoin. Im fully aware rejoin isnt fully functioning anymore, oof.

<h1>Steam Console</h1>
We can use the Steam Console to help get some basic troubleshooting information if MCC is failing to launch.

Press the Windows Key + R

Enter steam://open/console and the press Enter

This will add a console section to Steam with information about the processes being handled by Steam.
In the example below I’ve launched MCC after opening the console.

<h1>Restarting Search</h1>

If you find your lobby constantly cycling between “Connecting Session” and “Restarting Search”, there doesn’t appear to be anything client side we can do to resolve.

<h1>Fatal Error</h1>
Probably the trickiest error to resolve. I’ve seen some users where they had a faulty USB port on their PC which was causing the entire game to crash. 

Easiest way to track these down is through the Problem Reports section in Windows.
Press the Windows Key and type “Problem Reports.
You should have a row for Halo: The Master Chief Collection which you can double click.
If you don’t understand the Exception Codes - google them.

There are alternative ways to track these down as well. 
MCC may not write any information to the Problem Reports section.
For these more pesky errors we’ll need to go to the Event Viewer (or worst case scenario the dmp files).

Open the Event Viewer, expand Windows Logs and click the Application section.
By default it's sorted by Date and Time.

Find the related crash log (will have a yellow exclamation mark) and review the details.

Option three: find the AppData/LocalLow/MCC/Saved/Crashes folder.
The most recently created error folder will be at the top.
You can open the .dmp file with WinDbg and see something like the following:

Fun fact: the above null pointer error is the cause of the fatal error crash when trying to switch between Xbox Live accounts.

If you are too lazy to google the associated error codes/details: 
Go to Discord, add “theffapanda” as a friend, send screenshots of the errors you found and pray.

<h1>Game Crashing during Campaign Cutscenes</h1>

Lower FPS to 60 (or essentially half of your fps; if 240 hz monitor, choose 120, if 120 choose 60, etc).
Not sure the cause, listing here as a community fix.
